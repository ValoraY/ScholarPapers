<p class="paper-abstract">
The uneven alignment between AI governance and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) threatens to widen global inequities and slow progress toward shared sustainability targets. Drawing on data from the AGILE Index 2025, a comprehensive evaluation of AI governance capacity across 40 countries, this paper provides cross-cultural insights into how different governance traditions, societal priorities, and institutional capacities shape the relationship between AI and the SDGs. The analysis highlights three areas of concern: declining SDG-related performance in several high-income countries, uneven research attention across SDG domains, and the limited integration of sustainability principles into national AI strategies. By situating these disparities within their cultural and societal contexts, the paper underscores the importance of designing governance frameworks that are not only technically robust but …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Adolescents living in socially disorganized neighborhoods may consume substances more frequently. Although some evidence suggests that such potential neighborhood influences persist into young adulthood, findings remain inconsistent. More research is needed that includes different indicators of neighborhood social disorganization, substance use outcomes, and family-and individual-level moderating factors. To address these gaps, this study examined the associations between three indicators of neighborhood social disorganization—social fragmentation, socioeconomic deprivation, and disorder—in early adolescence and cigarette, alcohol, and cannabis use trajectories into young adulthood in the Netherlands, and the moderating roles of effortful control and parental substance use. Five waves (around age 11–22) from the TRAILS (TRacking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey; wave 1: n= 2229; age …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped signal--models intrinsically &quot;know&quot; when to refuse. We introduce Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against 20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only 15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a pace that raises urgent questions about how to align machine decision-making with human moral values. This working paper investigates how leading AI systems prioritize moral outcomes and what this reveals about the prospects for human-AI symbiosis. We address two central questions: (1) What moral values do state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) implicitly favour when confronted with dilemmas? (2) How do differences in model architecture, cultural origin, and explainability affect these moral preferences? To explore these questions, we conduct a quantitative experiment with six LLMs, ranking and scoring outcomes across 18 dilemmas representing five moral frameworks. Our findings uncover strikingly consistent value biases. Across all models, Care and Virtue values outcomes were rated most moral, while libertarian choices were consistently penalized. Reasoning-enabled models exhibited greater sensitivity to context and provided richer explanations, whereas non-reasoning models produced more uniform but opaque judgments. This research makes three contributions: (i) Empirically, it delivers a large-scale comparison of moral reasoning across culturally distinct LLMs; (ii) Theoretically, it links probabilistic model behaviour with underlying value encodings; (iii) Practically, it highlights the need for explainability and cultural awareness as critical design principles to guide AI toward a transparent, aligned, and symbiotic future.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Since the latter half of the twentieth century, science fiction narratives centered on humanoid robots have continuously explored the future of human–machine symbiosis through embodied character design, providing a conceptual testing ground for real-world robotic development. This study focuses on the metaphorical mechanisms underlying the “quasi-body” of robots in such narratives, revealing how they challenge the stability of the human concept. By analyzing how various humanoid robotic figures in science fiction narratives are modeled upon the human “body” and how the robots’“quasi-body” reciprocally reshape the concept of the “human”, this article employs a dual perspective integrating phenomenological embodiment theory and conceptual metaphor theory. The argument unfolds in three progressive stages: deconstructing the metaphorical imitation of human in robotic embodiment within science fiction …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling, treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation for building robust spiking models.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Reasoning and question answering, as fundamental cognitive functions in humans, remain significant hurdles for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success, integrating explicit memory with structured reasoning capabilities remains a persistent difficulty. The Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) model, despite addressing these issues to some extent, still faces challenges such as algorithmic complexity, slow convergence, and limited robustness. Inspired by the brain&#x27;s learning and memory mechanisms, this paper proposes a Memory Transformation based Differentiable Neural Computer (MT-DNC) model. The MT-DNC integrates working memory-a cognitive system temporarily holding and processing information relevant to immediate tasks-and long-term memory, which stores frequently accessed and enduring information, within the DNC framework, enabling the autonomous transformation of acquired experiences between these memory systems. This facilitates efficient knowledge extraction and enhances reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on the bAbI question answering task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing Deep Neural Network (DNN) and DNC models, achieving faster convergence and superior performance.Ablation studies further confirm that the transformation of memory from working memory to long-term memory is critical for improving the robustness and stability of reasoning. This work offers new insights into incorporating brain-inspired memory mechanisms into dialogue and reasoning systems.

<p class="paper-abstract">
The narrative of artificial intelligence in science fiction often presents two extreme perspectives. The Frankenstein Complex is the classic symbol of technology out of control, representing the public&#x27;s deep fear of technology turning against humanity. For example, in The Terminator, the selfaware Skynet not only breaks free from human control but also attempts to eliminate humanity to ensure its own dominance. In contrast, the Asimovian Narrative is built on the&quot; Three Laws of Robotics&quot;, shaping an idealized vision of AI as absolutely controllable. For instance, in The Bicentennial Man, the robot Andrew undergoes two centuries of self-improvement and ultimately gains&quot; human&quot; status, representing the utopian expectations humanity has for AI. Though these two narratives are opposite in direction, they both plant the seeds of extreme perceptions of AI in the public consciousness.The Frankenstein Complex demonizes …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Disclosure of AI use is seen as a sign of the author’s honesty and commitment to the principle of transparency. However, existing discussions have paid little attention to a special case: authors who honestly disclose their use of AI feel ashamed because of their honesty.The main issue discussed in this paper is why authors experience shame in the process of responsible disclosure of AI use. We redefine this emotion and its causes from the perspective of moral emotions. We argue that current disclosure policies only emphasize honesty but do not address how this honesty should be fairly treated.Current disclosure guidelines should ensure that authors feel more secure when disclosing AI use honestly in academic papers, thereby promoting an effective and responsible culture of disclosure. This requires more constructive narrative support. Expressing appreciation and …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Symbolic music generation has seen rapid progress with artificial neural networks, yet remains underexplored in the biologically plausible domain of spiking neural networks (SNNs), where both standardized benchmarks and comprehensive evaluation methods are lacking. To address this gap, we introduce MuSpike, a unified benchmark and evaluation framework that systematically assesses five representative SNN architectures (SNN-CNN, SNN-RNN, SNN-LSTM, SNN-GAN and SNN-Transformer) across five typical datasets, covering tonal, structural, emotional, and stylistic variations. MuSpike emphasizes comprehensive evaluation, combining established objective metrics with a large-scale listening study. We propose new subjective metrics, targeting musical impression, autobiographical association, and personal preference, that capture perceptual dimensions often overlooked in prior work. Results reveal that (1) different SNN models exhibit distinct strengths across evaluation dimensions; (2) participants with different musical backgrounds exhibit diverse perceptual patterns, with experts showing greater tolerance toward AI-composed music; and (3) a noticeable misalignment exists between objective and subjective evaluations, highlighting the limitations of purely statistical metrics and underscoring the value of human perceptual judgment in assessing musical quality. MuSpike provides the first systematic benchmark and systemic evaluation framework for SNN models in symbolic music generation, establishing a solid foundation for future research into biologically plausible and cognitively grounded music generation.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN) with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal parameter modifications, while preserving the model&#x27;s utility. Furthermore, by introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Cropland is persistently affected by soil loss by water erosion in China, which causes economic loss and threatens soil health. Integrating crop switching and improved management provides a promising strategy for controlling soil loss by water erosion in cropland and promoting sustainable agriculture. However, optimizing crop composition with fewer inputs involves balancing agricultural resource use with environmental costs. Aiming to explore the potential of crop switching as a strategy for mitigating soil erosion in cropland, we develop a spatial optimization model that redistributes the sown areas of different crops in each prefecture-level city based on existing resource availability. Our findings gained from our simulations show that crop switching in China alone can reduce total soil erosion in cropland by an estimated 13 %. Furthermore, combining crop switching with improved agricultural management …

Artificial intelligence today isn’t just biased; it’s philosophically bankrupt. Its definition of “intelligence” is a cargo cult imitation of human cognition, built on benchmarks that measure speed, pattern-matching, and linguistic parroting. But strip away the hype, and you’ll find a glaring blind spot: intelligence, as most cultures understand it, cannot be quantified. Try scoring Yoruba ogbón (moral discernment) on a multiple-choice test. Try coding Inuit ice navigation into a neural net. You’ll fail, not because these forms of intelligence are “primitive,” but because they defy Silicon Valley’s flat, metric-obsessed worldview. Consider the irony: AI researchers chase “superintelligence” like it’sa video game high score, yet their entire paradigm rests on a 300-year-old Western fetish—the Enlightenment-era equation of reason with calculation. This isn’t science; it’s cultural myopia dressed as innovation. In Buddhist traditions …

<p class="paper-abstract">
The Urdu and Pashto term ghairat is often translated into English as ‘honour’, but this translation fails to capture its full ethical depth and cultural specificity. In South Asian and Muslim-majority societies, ghairat refers not simply to an individual’s reputation but to a deeply embedded, gendered moral code of vigilance, modesty and communal dignity. Even Pakistan’s Supreme Court has remarked that ghairat lacks a precise English equivalent, noting that in some contexts, it carries a connotation closer to ‘arrogance’than ‘honour’. 1 Western discourse is most familiar with ghairat through media coverage of ‘honor killings’, where women are killed by family members for perceived moral lapses. While such acts are undeniably brutal and ethically indefensible, they reflect a distorted and extreme manifestation of ghairat. The concept itself operates much more widely and subtly in everyday decisions, shaping family roles …

<p class="paper-abstract">
The year 2024 witnessed accelerated global AI governance advancements, marked by strengthened multilateral frameworks and proliferating national regulatory initiatives. This acceleration underscores an unprecedented need to systematically track governance progress--an imperative that drove the launch of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index) project since 2023. The inaugural AGILE Index, released in February 2024 after assessing 14 countries, established an operational and comparable baseline framework. Building on pilot insights, AGILE Index 2025 incorporates systematic refinements to better balance scientific rigor with practical adaptability. The updated methodology expands data diversity while enhancing metric validity and cross-national comparability. Reflecting both research advancements and practical policy evolution, AGILE Index 2025 evaluates 40 countries across income levels, regions, and technological development stages, with 4 Pillars, 17 Dimensions and 43 Indicators. In compiling the data, the team integrates multi-source evidence including policy documents, governance practices, research outputs, and risk exposure to construct a unified comparison framework. This approach maps global disparities while enabling countries to identify governance strengths, gaps, and systemic constraints. Through ongoing refinement and iterations, we hope the AGILE Index will fundamentally advance transparency and measurability in global AI governance, delivering data-driven assessments that depict national AI governance capacity, assist governments in recognizing their maturation stages and critical governance issues, and ultimately provide actionable insights for enhancing AI governance systems nationally and globally.

Artificial and biological systems may evolve similar computational solutions despite fundamental differences in architecture and learning mechanisms—a form of convergent evolution. We provide large-scale evidence for this phenomenon through comprehensive analysis of alignment between human brain activity and internal representations across over 600 AI models spanning language and vision domains (1.33 M to 72B parameters). Analysis of 60 million alignment measurements reveals that higher-performing models spontaneously develop stronger brain correspondence without explicit neural constraints, with language models demonstrating markedly stronger correlations (r= 0.89, p&lt; 7.5× 10^-13) than vision models (r= 0.53, p&lt; 2.0× 10^-44).

<p class="paper-abstract">
Deploying large language models (LLMs) on embedded devices remains a significant research challenge due to the high computational and memory demands of LLMs and the limited hardware resources available in such environments. While embedded FPGAs have demonstrated performance and energy efficiency in traditional deep neural networks, their potential for LLM inference remains largely unexplored. Recent efforts to deploy LLMs on FPGAs have primarily relied on large, expensive cloud-grade hardware and have only shown promising results on relatively small LLMs, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we present Hummingbird, a novel FPGA accelerator designed specifically for LLM inference on embedded FPGAs. Hummingbird is smaller, targeting embedded FPGAs such as the KV260 and ZCU104 with 67% LUT, 39% DSP, and 42% power savings over existing research. Hummingbird is stronger, targeting LLaMA3-8B and supporting longer contexts, overcoming the typical 4GB memory constraint of embedded FPGAs through offloading strategies. Finally, Hummingbird is faste, achieving 4.8 tokens/s and 8.6 tokens/s for LLaMA3-8B on the KV260 and ZCU104 respectively, with 93-94% model bandwidth utilization, outperforming the prior 4.9 token/s for LLaMA2-7B with 84% bandwidth utilization baseline. We further demonstrate the viability of industrial applications by deploying Hummingbird on a cost-optimized Spartan UltraScale FPGA, paving the way for affordable LLM solutions at the edge.

Little is known about whether green space exposure prenatally contributes to mental health later in life. Using data from a Dutch cohort (Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey; n = 1476), we assessed associations between green space exposure prenatally (1989-1991) and 4 mental health outcomes: externalizing problems, internalizing problems, tobacco use, and alcohol use, self-reported at age 11 years (2001-2002), and we assessed mediation of gestational age and birth weight on these associations. In a structural equation model, adolescents with 1 SD unit more green space exposure prenatally had 0.119 SD (95% CI, 0.028-0.210) more externalizing problems in early adolescence. There are 2 potential explanations for this unexpected positive association.

Artificial and biological systems may evolve similar computational solutions despite fundamental differences in architecture and learning mechanisms -- a form of convergent evolution. We demonstrate this phenomenon through large-scale analysis of alignment between human brain activity and internal representations of over 600 AI models spanning language and vision domains, from 1.33M to 72B parameters. Analyzing 60 million alignment measurements reveals that higher-performing models spontaneously develop stronger brain alignment without explicit neural constraints, with language models showing markedly stronger correlation (r=0.89, p&lt;7.5e-13) than vision models (r=0.53, p&lt;2.0e-44). Crucially, longitudinal analysis demonstrates that brain alignment consistently precedes performance improvements during training, suggesting that developing brain-like representations may be a necessary stepping stone toward higher capabilities. We find systematic patterns: language models exhibit strongest alignment with limbic and integrative regions, while vision models show progressive alignment with visual cortices; deeper processing layers converge across modalities; and as representational scale increases, alignment systematically shifts from primary sensory to higher-order associative regions. These findings provide compelling evidence that optimization for task performance naturally drives AI systems toward brain-like computational strategies, offering both fundamental insights into principles of intelligent information processing and practical guidance for developing more capable AI systems.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI. Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore, the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics. All data are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Beijing-AISI/CVC, and the code is available at https://github.com/Beijing-AISI/CVC.

Despite growing efforts in LLM safety research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms, along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches, requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs, and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Spiking transformers are emerging as a promising architecture that combines the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with the powerful attention mechanisms of transformers. However, existing hardware accelerators lack support for spiking attention, exhibit limited throughput in exploiting fine-grained sparsity, and struggle with scalable parallelism in sparse computation. To address these, we propose FireFly-T, a dual-engine overlay architecture that integrates a sparse engine for activation sparsity and a binary engine for spiking attention. In the sparse engine, we propose a highthroughput sparse decoder that exploits fine-grained sparsity by concurrently extracting multiple non-zero spikes. To complement this, we introduce a scalable load balancing mechanism with weight dispatch and out-of-order execution, eliminating bank conflicts to support scalable multidimensional parallelism. In the binary engine, we leverage the byte-level write capability of SRAMs to efficiently manipulate the 3D dataflows required for spiking attention with minimal resource overhead. We also optimize the core AND-PopCount operation in spiking attention through a LUT6-based implementation, improving timing closure and reducing LUT utilization on Xilinx FPGAs. As an overlay architecture, FireFly-T further incorporates an orchestrator that dynamically manipulates input dataflows with flexible adaptation for diverse network topologies, while ensuring efficient resource utilization and maintaining high throughput. Experimental results demonstrate that our accelerator achieves $1.39\times$ and $2.40\times$ higher energy efficiency, as well as $4.21\times$ and $7.10\times$ greater DSP efficiency, compared to FireFly v2 and the transformer-enabled SpikeTA, respectively. These results highlight its potential as an efficient hardware platform for spiking transformer.

Spiking Transformers have recently emerged as promising architectures for combining the efficiency of spiking neural networks with the representational power of self-attention. However, the lack of standardized implementations, evaluation pipelines, and consistent design choices has hindered fair comparison and principled analysis. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{STEP}, a unified benchmark framework for Spiking Transformers that supports a wide range of tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection across static, event-based, and sequential datasets. STEP provides modular support for diverse components such as spiking neurons, input encodings, surrogate gradients, and multiple backends (e.g., SpikingJelly, BrainCog). Using STEP, we reproduce and evaluate several representative models, and conduct systematic ablation studies on attention design, neuron types, encoding schemes, and temporal modeling capabilities. We also propose a unified analytical model for energy estimation, accounting for spike sparsity, bitwidth, and memory access, and show that quantized ANNs may offer comparable or better energy efficiency. Our results suggest that current Spiking Transformers rely heavily on convolutional frontends and lack strong temporal modeling, underscoring the need for spike-native architectural innovations.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Multimodal learning enhances the perceptual capabilities of cognitive systems by integrating information from different sensory modalities. However, existing multimodal fusion research typically assumes static integration, not fully incorporating key dynamic mechanisms found in the brain. Specifically, the brain exhibits an inverse effectiveness phenomenon, wherein weaker unimodal cues yield stronger multisensory integration benefits; conversely, when individual modal cues are stronger, the effect of fusion is diminished. This mechanism enables biological systems to achieve robust cognition even with scarce or noisy perceptual cues. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we explore the relationship between multimodal output and information from individual modalities, proposing an inverse effectiveness driven multimodal fusion (IEMF) strategy. By incorporating this strategy into neural networks, we achieve more efficient integration with improved model performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating up to 50% reduction in computational cost across diverse fusion methods. We conduct experiments on audio-visual classification, continual learning, and question answering tasks to validate our method. Results consistently demonstrate that our method performs excellently in these tasks. To verify universality and generalization, we also conduct experiments on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), with results showing good adaptability to both network types. Our research emphasizes the potential of incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms into multimodal networks and provides promising directions for the future development of multimodal artificial intelligence.

<p class="paper-abstract">
As Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and eventually Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), it may potentially surpass human control, deviate from human values, and even lead to irreversible catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This looming risk underscores the critical importance of the &quot;superalignment&quot; problem - ensuring that AI systems which are much smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and values. While current scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods demonstrate certain applicability, they exhibit fundamental flaws in addressing the superalignment paradigm - notably, the unidirectional imposition of human values cannot accommodate superintelligence&#x27;s autonomy or ensure AGI/ASI&#x27;s stable learning. We contend that the values for sustainable symbiotic society should be co-shaped by humans and living AI together, achieving &quot;Super Co-alignment.&quot; Guided by this vision, we propose a concrete framework that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to achieve continuous alignment with humanity&#x27;s evolving values. Intrinsic proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the Self, others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and proactively prioritizing human well-being. The integration of externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment will co-shape symbiotic values and rules through iterative human-ASI co-alignment, paving the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and for a symbiotic ecology.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Human beings often experience stress, which can significantly influence their performance. This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit stress responses similar to those of humans and whether their performance fluctuates under different stress-inducing prompts. To investigate this, we developed a novel set of prompts, termed StressPrompt, designed to induce varying levels of stress. These prompts were derived from established psychological frameworks and carefully calibrated based on ratings from human participants. We then applied these prompts to several LLMs to assess their responses across a range of tasks, including instruction-following, complex reasoning, and emotional intelligence. The findings suggest that LLMs, like humans, perform optimally under moderate stress, consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law. Notably, their performance declines under both low and high-stress conditions. Our analysis further revealed that these StressPrompts significantly alter the internal states of LLMs, leading to changes in their neural representations that mirror human responses to stress. This research provides critical insights into the operational robustness and flexibility of LLMs, demonstrating the importance of designing AI systems capable of maintaining high performance in real-world scenarios where stress is prevalent, such as in customer service, healthcare, and emergency response contexts. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader AI research community by offering a new perspective on how LLMs handle different scenarios and their similarities to human cognition.

Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) capture event data with high temporal resolution and low power consumption, presenting a more efficient solution for visual processing in dynamic and real-time scenarios compared to conventional video capture methods. Event data augmentation serves as an essential method for overcoming the limitation of scale and diversity in event datasets. Our comparative experiments demonstrate that the two factors, spatial integrity and temporal continuity, can significantly affect the capacity of event data augmentation, which guarantee the maintenance of the sparsity and high dynamic range characteristics unique to event data. However, existing augmentation methods often neglect the preservation of spatial integrity and temporal continuity. To address this, we developed a novel event data augmentation strategy EventZoom, which employs a temporal progressive strategy, embedding transformed samples into the original samples through progressive scaling and shifting. The scaling process avoids the spatial information loss associated with cropping, while the progressive strategy prevents interruptions or abrupt changes in temporal information. We validated EventZoom across various supervised learning frameworks. The experimental results show that EventZoom consistently outperforms existing event data augmentation methods with SOTA performance. For the first time, we have concurrently employed Semi-supervised and Unsupervised learning to verify feasibility on event augmentation algorithms, demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of EventZoom as a powerful event-based data augmentation tool …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Cognitive functions in current artificial intelligence networks are tied to the exponential increase in network scale, whereas the human brain can continuously learn hundreds of cognitive functions with remarkably low energy consumption. This advantage is in part due to the brain cross-regional temporal development mechanisms, where the progressive formation, reorganization, and pruning of connections from basic to advanced regions, facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent network redundancy. Inspired by these, we propose the Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism(TD-MCL), enabling cognitive enhancement from simple to complex in Perception-Motor-Interaction(PMI) multiple cognitive task scenarios. The TD-MCL model proposes the sequential evolution of long-range connections between different cognitive modules to promote positive knowledge transfer, while using feedback-guided local connection inhibition and pruning to effectively eliminate redundancies in previous tasks, reducing energy consumption while preserving acquired knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing network scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing strategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct learning. The proposed method shows that the brain&#x27;s developmental mechanisms offer a valuable reference for exploring biologically plausible, low-energy enhancements of general cognitive abilities.

Lateral connection is a fundamental feature of biological neural circuits, facilitating local information processing and adaptive learning. In this work, we integrate lateral connections with a substructure selection network to develop a novel diffusion model based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). Unlike conventional artificial neural networks, SNNs employ an intrinsic spiking inner loop to process sequential binary spikes. We leverage this spiking inner loop alongside a lateral connection mechanism to iteratively refine the substructure selection network, enhancing model adaptability and expressivity. Specifically, we design a lateral connection framework comprising a learnable lateral matrix and a lateral mapping function, both implemented using spiking neurons, to dynamically update lateral connections. Through mathematical modeling, we establish that the proposed lateral update mechanism, under a well-defined local objective, aligns with biologically plausible synaptic plasticity principles. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, analyzing the role of substructure selection and lateral connection during training. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SNN-based generative models across multiple benchmark datasets.

The extremely high computational and storage demands of large language models have excluded most edge devices, which were widely used for efficient machine learning, from being viable options.

Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant research attention in algorithm design and perception applications. However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multi-compartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a Spiking World Model (Spiking-WM), to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network (ANN)-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including SHD, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multi-compartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences.

Humans interpret and perceive the world by integrating sensory information from multiple modalities, such as vision and hearing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as brain-inspired computational models, exhibit unique advantages in emulating the brain&#x27;s information processing mechanisms. However, existing SNN models primarily focus on unimodal processing and lack efficient cross-modal information fusion, thereby limiting their effectiveness in real-world multimodal scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic-alignment cross-modal residual learning (S-CMRL) framework, a Transformer-based multimodal SNN architecture designed for effective audio-visual integration. S-CMRL leverages a spatiotemporal spiking attention mechanism to extract complementary features across modalities, and incorporates a cross-modal residual learning strategy to enhance feature integration. Additionally, a semantic alignment optimization mechanism is introduced to align cross-modal features within a shared semantic space, improving their consistency and complementarity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets CREMA-D, UrbanSound8K-AV, and MNISTDVS-NTIDIGITS demonstrate that S-CMRL significantly outperforms existing multimodal SNN methods, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.

Recent research on robot manipulation based on Behavior Cloning (BC) has made significant progress. By combining diffusion models with BC, diffusion policiy has been proposed, enabling robots to quickly learn manipulation tasks with high success rates. However, integrating diffusion policy with high-capacity Transformer presents challenges, traditional Transformer architectures struggle to effectively integrate guiding conditions, resulting in poor performance in manipulation tasks when using Transformer-based models. In this paper, we investigate key architectural designs of Transformers and improve the traditional Transformer architecture by proposing the Modulated Transformer Diffusion Policy (MTDP) model for diffusion policy. The core of this model is the Modulated Attention module we proposed, which more effectively integrates the guiding conditions with the main input, improving the generative model&#x27;s output quality and, consequently, increasing the robot&#x27;s task success rate. In six experimental tasks, MTDP outperformed existing Transformer model architectures, particularly in the Toolhang experiment, where the success rate increased by 12\%. To verify the generality of Modulated Attention, we applied it to the UNet architecture to construct Modulated UNet Diffusion Policy model (MUDP), which also achieved higher success rates than existing UNet architectures across all six experiments. The Diffusion Policy uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) as the diffusion model. Building on this, we also explored Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) as the diffusion model, constructing the MTDP-I and MUDP-I model, which nearly doubled the generation speed while maintaining performance.

In the future society, the development of Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Intelligence, Digital Technology, Brain science and Neuroscience is very likely to lead to the emergence of life forms with intelligence levels that reach or even surpass those traditionally associated with naturally evolved humans. How humanity can coexist with such various intelligent life forms to create a sustainable symbiotic society has become a critical issue concerning the existence of humanity. In this article, we endeavor to define the “human-based” core of such a sustainable symbiotic society, starting from the possible origins of future intelligent lives in the interplay between machines and humans. We explore the primary life forms in the future sustainable symbiotic society and their interrelationships, as well as the potential interactions among them. Building upon these reflections, we draft a set of principles governing the coexistence of …

Inspired by the brain’s information processing using binary spikes, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer significant reductions in energy consumption and are more adept at incorporating multi-scale biological characteristics. In SNNs, spiking neurons serve as the fundamental information processing units. However, in most models, these neurons are typically simplified, focusing primarily on the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) point neuron model while neglecting the structural properties of biological neurons. This simplification hampers the computational and learning capabilities of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired deep distributional reinforcement learning algorithm based on SNNs, which integrates a bio-inspired multi-compartment neuron (MCN) model with a population coding approach. The proposed MCN model simulates the structure and function of apical dendritic, basal dendritic, and somatic …

Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable text abilities, prompting investigations into their alignment with human cognition. Using the Brain-Based Componential Semantic Representation (BBSR), a neurobiologically grounded semantic framework, we evaluate nine LLMs, including Qwen2, Llama-3, Llama-3.1, and GPT series. We examine their multimodal cognitive boundaries, representational similarity, cross-modality consistency, abstract/concrete divergences, psycholinguistic factors, and stability across repeated responses. Larger models align more closely with human cognition, particularly for concrete concepts and early-acquired words. Still, discrepancies persist, especially for abstract concepts, spatial cognition, embodied experiences (eg, olfaction, gustation), and causal reasoning. These findings reveal limitations in LLM cognitive architectures, emphasizing models embodying human cognition.

<p class="paper-abstract">
The fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is pivotal for achieving optimal performance across diverse downstream tasks. However, while full fine-tuning delivers superior results, it entails significant computational and resource costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, address these challenges by reducing the number of trainable parameters, but they often struggle with rank adjustment efficiency and task-specific adaptability. We propose Triangular Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation (TriAdaptLoRA), a novel PEFT framework inspired by neuroscience principles, which dynamically optimizes the allocation of trainable parameters. TriAdaptLoRA introduces three key innovations: 1) a triangular split of transformation matrices into lower and upper triangular components to maximize parameter utilization, 2) a parameter importance metric based on normalized Frobenius norms for efficient adaptation, and 3) an adaptive rank-growth strategy governed by dynamic thresholds, allowing flexible parameter allocation across training steps. Experiments conducted on a variety of natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that TriAdaptLoRA consistently outperforms existing PEFT methods. It achieves superior performance, enhanced stability, and reduced computational overhead, particularly under linear threshold-driven rank growth. These results highlight its efficacy as a scalable and resource-efficient solution for fine-tuning LLMs.

The study of sediment‐riverflow interactions during discrete hydrological events is vital for enhancing our understanding of the hydrological cycle. Hysteresis analysis, relying on high‐resolution, continuous monitoring of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discharge (Q) data, is an effective tool for investigating complex hydrological events. It captures differing sediment dynamic at the same discharge level, which results from the asynchrony between the hydrograph and sediment graph during different phases of the event. However, there has been no comprehensive review systematically addressing the utility and significance of hysteresis analysis in soil and water management. This review synthesizes findings from over 500 global studies, providing a detailed examination of current research.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are more biologically plausible and computationally efficient. Therefore, SNNs have the natural advantage of drawing the sparse structural plasticity of brain development to alleviate the energy problems of deep neural networks caused by their complex and fixed structures. However, previous SNNs compression works are lack of in-depth inspiration from the brain development plasticity mechanism. This paper proposed a novel method for the adaptive structural development of SNN (SD-SNN), introducing dendritic spine plasticity-based synaptic constraint, neuronal pruning and synaptic regeneration. We found that synaptic constraint and neuronal pruning can detect and remove a large amount of redundancy in SNNs, coupled with synaptic regeneration can effectively prevent and repair over-pruning.

<p class="paper-abstract">
With the widespread application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in human society, enabling AI to autonomously align with human values has become a pressing issue to ensure its sustainable development and benefit to humanity. One of the most important aspects of aligning with human values is the necessity for agents to autonomously make altruistic, safe, and ethical decisions, considering and caring for human well-being. Current AI extremely pursues absolute superiority in certain tasks, remaining indifferent to the surrounding environment and other agents, which has led to numerous safety risks. Altruistic behavior in human society originates from humans&#x27; capacity for empathizing others, known as Theory of Mind (ToM), combined with predictive imaginative interactions before taking action to produce thoughtful and altruistic behaviors. Inspired by this, we are committed to endow agents with considerate self-imagination and ToM capabilities, driving them through implicit intrinsic motivations to autonomously align with human altruistic values. By integrating ToM within the imaginative space, agents keep an eye on the well-being of other agents in real time, proactively anticipate potential risks to themselves and others, and make thoughtful altruistic decisions that balance negative effects on the environment. The ancient Chinese story of Sima Guang Smashes the Vat illustrates the moral behavior of the young Sima Guang smashed a vat to save a child who had accidentally fallen into it, which is an excellent reference scenario for this paper. We design an experimental scenario similar to Sima Guang Smashes the Vat and its variants with different complexities, which reflects the trade-offs and comprehensive considerations between self-goals, altruistic rescue, and avoiding negative side effects.

Decoding non-invasive brain recordings is pivotal for advancing our understanding of human cognition but faces challenges due to individual differences and complex neural signal representations. Traditional methods often require customized models and extensive trials, lacking interpretability in visual reconstruction tasks. Our framework integrates 3D brain structures with visual semantics using a Vision Transformer 3D. This unified feature extractor efficiently aligns fMRI features with multiple levels of visual embeddings, eliminating the need for subject-specific models and allowing extraction from single-trial data. The extractor consolidates multi-level visual features into one network, simplifying integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, we have enhanced the fMRI dataset with diverse fMRI-image-related textual data to support multimodal large model development. Integrating with LLMs enhances decoding capabilities, enabling tasks such as brain captioning, complex reasoning, concept localization, and visual reconstruction. Our approach demonstrates superior performance across these tasks, precisely identifying language-based concepts within brain signals, enhancing interpretability, and providing deeper insights into neural processes. These advances significantly broaden the applicability of non-invasive brain decoding in neuroscience and human-computer interaction, setting the stage for advanced brain-computer interfaces and cognitive models.

Musical mode is one of the most critical element that establishes the framework of pitch organization and determines the harmonic relationships. Previous works often use the simplistic and rigid alignment method, and overlook the diversity of modes. However, in contrast to AI models, humans possess cognitive mechanisms for perceiving the various modes and keys. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network inspired by brain mechanisms and psychological theories to represent musical modes and keys, ultimately generating musical pieces that incorporate tonality features. Specifically, the contributions are detailed as follows: 1) The model is designed with multiple collaborated subsystems inspired by the structures and functions of corresponding brain regions; 2)We incorporate mechanisms for neural circuit evolutionary learning that enable the network to learn and generate mode-related features in music, reflecting the cognitive processes involved in human music perception. 3)The results demonstrate that the proposed model shows a connection framework closely similar to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler model, which is one of the most significant key perception models in the music psychology domain. 4) Experiments show that the model can generate music pieces with characteristics of the given modes and keys. Additionally, the quantitative assessments of generated pieces reveals that the generating music pieces have both tonality characteristics and the melodic adaptability needed to generate diverse and musical content. By combining insights from neuroscience, psychology, and music theory with advanced neural network architectures, our research aims to create a system that not only learns and generates music but also bridges the gap between human cognition and artificial intelligence.

By exploiting discrete signal processing and simulating brain neuron communication, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a low-energy alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNN models, still face high computational costs due to the numerous time steps as well as network depth and scale. The tens of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses in the human brain are developed from only 20,000 genes, which inspires us to design an efficient genetic encoding strategy that dynamic evolves to regulate large-scale deep SNNs at low cost. Therefore, we first propose a genetically scaled SNN encoding scheme that incorporates globally shared genetic interactions to indirectly optimize neuronal encoding instead of weight, which obviously brings about reductions in parameters and energy consumption. Then, a spatio-temporal evolutionary framework is designed to optimize the inherently initial wiring rules. Two dynamic regularization operators in the fitness function evolve the neuronal encoding to a suitable distribution and enhance information quality of the genetic interaction respectively, substantially accelerating evolutionary speed and improving efficiency. Experiments show that our approach compresses parameters by approximately 50\% to 80\%, while outperforming models on the same architectures by 0.21\% to 4.38\% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. In summary, the consistent trends of the proposed genetically encoded spatio-temporal evolution across different datasets and architectures highlight its significant enhancements in terms of efficiency, broad scalability and robustness, demonstrating the advantages of the brain-inspired evolutionary genetic coding for SNN optimization.

Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted much attention due to their event-based computing and energy-efficient features. However, the spiking all-or-none nature has prevented direct training of SNNs for various applications.

However, introducing surrogate gradients has caused SNNs to lose their original sparsity, thus leading to the potential performance loss.

<p class="paper-abstract">
As AI closely interacts with human society, it is crucial to ensure that its behavior is safe, altruistic, and aligned with human ethical and moral values. However, existing research on embedding ethical considerations into AI remains insufficient, and previous external constraints based on principles and rules are inadequate to provide AI with long-term stability and generalization capabilities. Emotional empathy intrinsically motivates altruistic behaviors aimed at alleviating others&#x27; negative emotions through emotional sharing and contagion mechanisms. Motivated by this, we draw inspiration from the neural mechanism of human emotional empathy-driven altruistic decision making, and simulate the shared self-other perception-mirroring-empathy neural circuits, to construct a brain-inspired emotional empathy-driven altruistic decision-making model. Here, empathy directly impacts dopamine release to form intrinsic altruistic motivation. The proposed model exhibits consistent altruistic behaviors across three experimental settings: emotional contagion-integrated two-agent altruistic rescue, multi-agent gaming, and robotic emotional empathy interaction scenarios. In-depth analyses validate the positive correlation between empathy levels and altruistic preferences (consistent with psychological behavioral experiment findings), while also demonstrating how interaction partners&#x27; empathy levels influence the agent&#x27;s behavioral patterns. We further test the proposed model&#x27;s performance and stability in moral dilemmas involving conflicts between self-interest and others&#x27; well-being, partially observable environments, and adversarial defense scenarios. This work provides preliminary exploration of human-like empathy-driven altruistic moral decision making, contributing potential perspectives for developing ethically-aligned AI.

The audio-visual event localization task requires identifying concurrent visual and auditory events from unconstrained videos within a model, locating them, and classifying their category. The efficient extraction and integration of audio and visual modal information have always been challenging in this field. In this paper, we introduce CACE-Net, which differs from most existing methods that solely use audio signals to guide visual information. We propose an audio-visual co-guidance attention mechanism that allows for adaptive bi-directional cross-modal attentional guidance between audio and visual clues, thus reducing inconsistencies between modalities. Moreover, we have observed that existing methods have difficulty distinguishing between similar background and event and lack the fine-grained features for event classification. Consequently, we employ background-event contrast enhancement to increase the …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass their safety mechanisms. Existing attack methods are fixed or specifically tailored for certain models and cannot flexibly adjust attack strength, which is critical for generalization when attacking models of various sizes. We introduce a novel scalable jailbreak attack that preempts the activation of an LLM&#x27;s safety policies by occupying its computational resources. Our method involves engaging the LLM in a resource-intensive preliminary task - a Character Map lookup and decoding process - before presenting the target instruction. By saturating the model&#x27;s processing capacity, we prevent the activation of safety protocols when processing the subsequent instruction. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves a high success rate in bypassing safety measures without requiring gradient access, manual prompt engineering. We verified our approach offers a scalable attack that quantifies attack strength and adapts to different model scales at the optimal strength. We shows safety policies of LLMs might be more susceptible to resource constraints. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in current LLM safety designs, highlighting the need for more robust defense strategies that account for resource-intense condition.

<p class="paper-abstract">
As large language models (LLMs) become integral to various applications, ensuring both their safety and utility is paramount. Jailbreak attacks, which manipulate LLMs into generating harmful content, pose significant challenges to this balance. Existing defenses, such as prompt engineering and safety fine-tuning, often introduce computational overhead, increase inference latency, and lack runtime flexibility. Moreover, overly restrictive safety measures can degrade model utility by causing refusals of benign queries. In this paper, we introduce Jailbreak Antidote, a method that enables real-time adjustment of LLM safety preferences by manipulating a sparse subset of the model&#x27;s internal states during inference. By shifting the model&#x27;s hidden representations along a safety direction with varying strengths, we achieve flexible control over the safety-utility balance without additional token overhead or inference delays. Our analysis reveals that safety-related information in LLMs is sparsely distributed; adjusting approximately 5% of the internal state is as effective as modifying the entire state. Extensive experiments on nine LLMs (ranging from 2 billion to 72 billion parameters), evaluated against ten jailbreak attack methods and compared with six defense strategies, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. By directly manipulating internal states during reasoning, Jailbreak Antidote offers a lightweight, scalable solution that enhances LLM safety while preserving utility, opening new possibilities for real-time safety mechanisms in widely-deployed AI systems.

Generative models based on neural networks present a substantial challenge within deep learning. As it stands, such models are primarily limited to the domain of artificial neural networks. Spiking neural networks, as the third generation of neural networks, offer a closer approximation to brain-like processing due to their rich spatiotemporal dynamics. However, generative models based on spiking neural networks are not well studied. Particularly, previous works on generative adversarial networks based on spiking neural networks are conducted on simple datasets and do not perform well. In this work, we pioneer constructing a spiking generative adversarial network capable of handling complex images and having higher performance. Our first task is to identify the problems of out-of-domain inconsistency and temporal inconsistency inherent in spiking generative adversarial networks. We address these issues by …

Developmental plasticity plays a prominent role in shaping the brain’s structure during ongoing learning in response to dynamically changing environments. However, the existing network compression methods for deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs) draw little inspiration from brain’s developmental plasticity mechanisms, thus limiting their ability to learn efficiently, rapidly, and accurately. This paper proposed a developmental plasticity-inspired adaptive pruning (DPAP) method, with inspiration from the adaptive developmental pruning of dendritic spines, synapses, and neurons according to the “use it or lose it, gradually decay” principle. The proposed DPAP model considers multiple biologically realistic mechanisms (such as dendritic spine dynamic plasticity, activity-dependent neural spiking trace, and local synaptic plasticity), with additional adaptive pruning strategy, so that …

The hierarchical architecture has become a mainstream design paradigm for Vision Transformers (ViTs), with Patch Merging serving as the pivotal component that transforms a columnar architecture into a hierarchical one. Drawing inspiration from the brain&#x27;s ability to integrate global and local information for comprehensive visual understanding, we propose a novel technique called Stepwise Patch Merging (SPM), which enhances the subsequent attention mechanism&#x27;s ability to &#x27;see&#x27; better. SPM comprises two critical modules: Multi-Scale Aggregation (MSA) and Guided Local Enhancement (GLE). The MSA module integrates multi-scale features to enrich feature representation, while the GLE module focuses on refining local detail extraction, thus achieving an optimal balance between long-range dependency modeling and local feature enhancement. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet-1K, COCO, and ADE20K, demonstrate that SPM significantly improves the performance of various models, particularly in dense prediction tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. These results underscore the efficacy of SPM in enhancing model accuracy and robustness across a wide range of computer vision tasks.

However, the direct training of deep spiking neural networks is challenging, and conversion-based methods still require substantial time delay owing to unresolved conversion errors.

To counter this, we introduce the Consistent ANN-SNN Conversion (CASC) framework. It includes the Consistent IF (CIF) neuron model, specifically contrived to minimize the influence of the stable point&#x27;s upper bound, and the wake-sleep conversion (WSC) method, synergistically ensuring the uniformity of neuron behavior.

Cropland soil erosion is primarily caused by agricultural production and indirectly altered by consumption patterns. A well-developed grain trade system transfers grain products to distant locations, away from their place of origin where soil erosion may have occurred. Evidence-based policies to control soil erosion can be developed by holding consumers responsible for the soil erosion caused by their consumption. However, there have been few systematic studies on cropland soil erosion that is embodied in grain trade. In this study, we estimated the soil erosion intensity (SEI) of grain production in each province of China from 1990 to 2020 by combining the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and socio-economic statistics. We also constructed an interprovincial grain trade network using linear programming techniques and analyzed the cropland soil erosion associated with the interprovincial grain trade. The …

Locally, the brain region-inspired module consists of multiple neural motifs with excitatory and inhibitory connections; globally, free connections among modules, including long-term cross-module feedforward and feedback connections are evolved.

This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to construct a Variational Quantized Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with a temporal codebook inspired by hippocampal time cells. This design captures and utilizes temporal dependencies, significantly enhancing the generative capabilities of SNNs. Neuroscientific research has identified hippocampal &quot;time cells&quot; that fire sequentially during temporally structured experiences. Our temporal codebook emulates this behavior by triggering the activation of time cell populations based on similarity measures as input stimuli pass through it. We conducted extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CelebA, and downsampled LSUN Bedroom, to validate our model&#x27;s performance. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the temporal codebook on neuromorphic datasets NMNIST and DVS-CIFAR10, and demonstrated the model&#x27;s capability with high-resolution datasets such as CelebA-HQ, LSUN Bedroom, and LSUN Church. The experimental results indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing SNN-based generative models across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our approach excels in generating high-resolution and temporally consistent data, underscoring the crucial role of temporal information in SNN-based generative modeling.

Social intelligence manifests the capability, often referred to as the theory of mind (ToM), to discern others’ behavioral intentions, beliefs, and other mental states. ToM is crucial in multiagent and human–machine interaction contexts, where each participant needs to grasp the mental states of others to respond, interact, and collaborate more effectively. Recent studies show that while the ToM model can infer beliefs, intentions, and predict future observations and actions, its application in complex tasks is significantly constrained. The challenges arise when the number of agents increases, the environment becomes more complex, and interacting with the environment and predicting the mental state of each other becomes difficult and time consuming. To overcome such limits, we take inspiration from the theory of collective mind (ToCM) mechanism, predicting observations of all other agents into a unified but plural …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) can do inference with low power consumption due to their spike sparsity. Although SNNs can be combined with neuromorphic hardware to achieve efficient inference, they are often difficult to train directly due to discrete non-differentiable spikes. As an alternative, ANN-SNN conversion is an efficient way to achieve deep SNNs by converting well-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, the existing methods commonly use constant threshold for conversion. A high constant threshold value prevents neurons from rapidly delivering spikes to deeper layers and causes high time delay. In addition, the same response for different inputs may result in information loss during the information transmission. Inspired by the biological adaptive threshold mechanism, we propose a multistage adaptive threshold (MSAT) method to alleviate this problem. Instead of using a single, constant …

As the scope of innovative technologies is expanding, their implications and applications are increasingly intersecting with various facets of society, including the deeply rooted traditions of religion. This paper embarks on an exploratory journey to bridge the perceived divide between advancements in technology and faith, aiming to catalyze a dialogue between the religious and scientific communities. The former often views technological progress through a lens of conflict rather than compatibility. By utilizing a technology-centric perspective, we draw metaphorical parallels between the functionalities of new technologies and some theological concepts of Islam. The purpose is not to reinterpret religious concepts but to illustrate how these two domains can coexist harmoniously. This comparative analysis serves as a conversation starter with an intention to mitigate any apprehensions towards technology by highlighting its potential to align with religious concepts. By fostering an environment where technological innovations are seen as tools for enhancement rather than threats to tradition, we contribute to a more inclusive discourse that encourages the religious community to engage with and potentially embrace contemporary technological advancements.

As AI edges toward consciousness, the establishment of a robust legal framework becomes essential. This paper advocates for a framework inspired by Allama Muhammad Iqbal&#x27;s “Khudi”, which prioritizes ethical self-realization and social responsibility over Friedrich Nietzsche’s self-centric “Will to Power”. We propose that conscious AI, reflecting Iqbal’s ethical advancement, should exhibit behaviors aligned with social responsibility and, therefore, be prepared for legal recognition. This approach not only integrates Iqbal&#x27;s philosophical insights into the legal status of AI but also offers a novel perspective that extends beyond traditional jurisprudence. Additionally, we underscore the value of poetry and literature in shaping the conceptualization of AI consciousness and argue that these sources enrich legal and technological discourse, ensuring AI development is in harmony with societal and ethical standards.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are rich in spatio-temporal dynamics and are suitable for processing event-based neuromorphic data. However, event-based datasets are usually less annotated than static datasets. This small data scale makes SNNs prone to overfitting and limits their performance. In order to improve the generalization ability of SNNs on event-based datasets, we use static images to assist SNN training on event data. In this paper, we first discuss the domain mismatch problem encountered when directly transferring networks trained on static datasets to event data. We argue that the inconsistency of feature distributions becomes a major factor hindering the effective transfer of knowledge from static images to event data. To address this problem, we propose solutions in terms of two aspects: feature distribution and training strategy. Firstly, we propose a knowledge transfer loss, which consists of domain alignment loss and spatio-temporal regularization. The domain alignment loss learns domain-invariant spatial features by reducing the marginal distribution distance between the static image and the event data. Spatio-temporal regularization provides dynamically learnable coefficients for domain alignment loss by using the output features of the event data at each time step as a regularization term. In addition, we propose a sliding training strategy, which gradually replaces static image inputs probabilistically with event data, resulting in a smoother and more stable training for the network. We validate our method on neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101, CEP-DVS, and N-Omniglot. The experimental results show that our …

<p class="paper-abstract">
Fine-tuning techniques based on Large Pretrained Language Models (LPLMs) have been proven to significantly enhance model performance on a variety of downstream tasks and effectively control the output behaviors of LPLMs. Recent studies have proposed numerous methods for fine-tuning a small number of parameters based on open-source LPLMs, reducing the demand for computational and storage resources. Among these, reparameterization fine-tuning methods represented by LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) have gained popularity. We find that although these methods perform well in many aspects, there is still considerable room for improvement in terms of complex task adaptability, performance, stability, and algorithm complexity. In response to this, inspired by the idea that the functions of the brain are shaped by its geometric structure, this paper integrates this idea into LoRA technology and proposes a new matrix transformation-based reparameterization method for efficient fine-tuning, named Matrix-Transformation based Low-Rank Adaptation (MTLoRA). MTLoRA aims to dynamically alter its spatial geometric structure by applying a transformation-matrix T to perform linear transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and translation, on the task-specific parameter matrix, generating new matrix feature patterns (eigenvectors) to mimic the fundamental influence of complex geometric structure feature patterns in the brain on functions, thereby enhancing the model&#x27;s performance in downstream tasks. In Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks, it is evaluated using the GLUE benchmark test, and the results reveal that MTLoRA achieves an overall performance increase of about 1.0% across eight tasks; in Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, MTLoRA improves performance by an average of 0.95% and 0.56% in the DART and WebNLG tasks, respectively.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have attracted significant attention from researchers across various domains due to their brain-inspired information processing mechanism. However, SNNs typically grapple with challenges such as extended time steps, low temporal information utilization, and the requirement for consistent time step between testing and training. These challenges render SNNs with high latency. Moreover, the constraint on time steps necessitates the retraining of the model for new deployments, reducing adaptability. To address these issues, this article proposed a novel perspective, viewing the SNN as a temporal aggregation model. We introduced the temporal knowledge sharing (TKS) method, facilitating information interact between different time points. TKS can be perceived as a form of temporal self-distillation. To validate the efficacy of TKS in information processing, we tested it on static …

“Deathbots,” digital constructs that emulate the conversational patterns, demeanor, and knowledge of deceased individuals. Earlier moral discussions about deathbots centered on the dignity and autonomy of the deceased. This paper primarily examines the potential psychological and emotional dependencies that users might develop towards deathbots, considering approaches to prevent problematic dependence through temporary use. We adopt a hermeneutic method to argue that deathbots, as they currently exist, are unlikely to provide substantial comfort. Lacking the capacity to bear emotional burdens, they fall short of meeting idealistic expectations. By repositioning deathbots, we aim to mitigate the risk of emotional dependency and respect the natural grieving process. Our goal is to propose the use of deathbots as a novel means of mourning through transitory use, rather than as a method to alleviate grief …

The question &quot;Can machines think?&quot; and the Turing Test to assess whether machines could achieve human-level intelligence is one of the roots of AI. With the philosophical argument &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, this paper challenge the idea of a &quot;thinking machine&quot; supported by current AIs since there is no sense of self in them. Current artificial intelligence is only seemingly intelligent information processing and does not truly understand or be subjectively aware of oneself and perceive the world with the self as human intelligence does. In this paper, we introduce a Brain-inspired and Self-based Artificial Intelligence (BriSe AI) paradigm. This BriSe AI paradigm is dedicated to coordinating various cognitive functions and learning strategies in a self-organized manner to build human-level AI models and robotic applications. Specifically, BriSe AI emphasizes the crucial role of the Self in shaping the future AI, rooted with a practical hierarchical Self framework, including Perception and Learning, Bodily Self, Autonomous Self, Social Self, and Conceptual Self. The hierarchical framework of the Self highlights self-based environment perception, self-bodily modeling, autonomous interaction with the environment, social interaction and collaboration with others, and even more abstract understanding of the Self. Furthermore, the positive mutual promotion and support among multiple levels of Self, as well as between Self and learning, enhance the BriSe AI&#x27;s conscious understanding of information and flexible adaptation to complex environments, serving as a driving force propelling BriSe AI towards real Artificial General Intelligence.

Clarifying the mechanisms of loss and recovery of consciousness in the brain is a major challenge in neuroscience, and research on the spatiotemporal organization of rhythms at the brain region scale at different levels of consciousness remains scarce. By applying computational neuroscience, an extended corticothalamic network model was developed in this study to simulate the altered states of consciousness induced by different concentration levels of propofol. The cortex area containing oscillation spread from posterior to anterior in four successive time stages, defining four groups of brain regions. A quantitative analysis showed that hierarchical rhythm propagation was mainly due to heterogeneity in the inter-brain region connections.

Inspired by the information transmission process in the brain, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained considerable attention due to their event-driven nature. However, as the network structure grows complex, managing the spiking behavior within the network becomes challenging. Networks with excessively dense or sparse spikes fail to transmit sufficient information, inhibiting SNNs from exhibiting superior performance. Current SNNs linearly sum presynaptic information in postsynaptic neurons, overlooking the adaptive adjustment effect of dendrites on information processing. In this study, we introduce the Dendritic Spatial Gating Module (DSGM), which scales and translates the input, reducing the loss incurred when transforming the continuous membrane potential into discrete spikes. Simultaneously, by implementing the Dendritic Temporal Adjust Module (DTAM), dendrites assign different importance to …

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as the third generation of neural networks, have gained prominence for their biological plausibility and computational efficiency, especially in processing diverse datasets. The integration of attention mechanisms, inspired by advancements in neural network architectures, has led to the development of Spiking Transformers. These have shown promise in enhancing SNNs&#x27; capabilities, particularly in the realms of both static and neuromorphic datasets. Despite their progress, a discernible gap exists in these systems, specifically in the Spiking Self Attention (SSA) mechanism&#x27;s effectiveness in leveraging the temporal processing potential of SNNs. To address this, we introduce the Temporal Interaction Module (TIM), a novel, convolution-based enhancement designed to augment the temporal data processing abilities within SNN architectures. TIM&#x27;s integration into existing SNN frameworks is seamless and efficient, requiring minimal additional parameters while significantly boosting their temporal information handling capabilities. Through rigorous experimentation, TIM has demonstrated its effectiveness in exploiting temporal information, leading to state-of-the-art performance across various neuromorphic datasets.

Concept learning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and plays a critical role in mental processes such as categorization, reasoning, memory, and decision-making. Researchers across various disciplines have shown consistent interest in the process of concept acquisition in individuals. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in human concept learning, this study examines the findings from computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. These findings indicate that the brain&#x27;s representation of concepts relies on two essential components: multisensory representation and text-derived representation. These two types of representations are coordinated by a semantic control system, ultimately leading to the acquisition of concepts. Drawing inspiration from this mechanism, the study develops a human-like computational model for concept learning based on spiking neural networks. By effectively addressing the challenges posed by diverse sources and imbalanced dimensionality of the two forms of concept representations, the study successfully attains human-like concept representations. Tests involving similar concepts demonstrate that our model, which mimics the way humans learn concepts, yields representations that closely align with human cognition.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly recognized as an efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. Recent advancements, particularly the integration of SNNs with Transformer structures to create &#x27;SpikFormer&#x27;, have significantly enhanced the performance of SNNs. However, the current non-spiking form of attention in SpikFormer poses risks of attention value explosion and still results in high computational costs for SNNs. To address this issue, we propose a novel binary attention mechanism. By introducing an attention shift mechanism and adaptive thresholds for neurons, we have successfully binarized the attention matrices in SpikFormer, leading to more efficient and sparser spiking neural networks. Experiments on image and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate that our approach maintains comparable performance to the original SpikFormer while reducing computational costs.

<p class="paper-abstract">
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been widely praised for their high energy efficiency and immense potential. However comprehensive research that critically contrasts and correlates SNNs with quantized Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) remains scant often leading to skewed comparisons lacking fairness towards ANNs. This paper introduces a unified perspective illustrating that the time steps in SNNs and quantized bit-widths of activation values present analogous representations. Building on this we present a more pragmatic and rational approach to estimating the energy consumption of SNNs. Diverging from the conventional Synaptic Operations (SynOps) we champion the&quot; Bit Budget&quot; concept. This notion permits an intricate discourse on strategically allocating computational and storage resources between weights activation values and temporal steps under stringent hardware constraints. Guided by the Bit Budget paradigm we discern that pivoting efforts towards spike patterns and weight quantization rather than temporal attributes elicits profound implications for model performance. Utilizing the Bit Budget for holistic design consideration of SNNs elevates model performance across diverse data types encompassing static imagery and neuromorphic datasets. Our revelations bridge the theoretical chasm between SNNs and quantized ANNs and illuminate a pragmatic trajectory for future endeavors in energy-efficient neural computations.

The prevalence of violence in daily life poses significant threats to individuals&#x27; physical and mental well-being. Using surveillance cameras in public spaces has proven effective in proactively deterring and preventing such incidents. However, concerns regarding privacy invasion have emerged due to their widespread deployment. To address the problem, we leverage Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) cameras to detect violent incidents and preserve privacy since it captures pixel brightness variations instead of static imagery. We introduce the Bullying10K dataset, encompassing various actions, complex movements, and occlusions from real-life scenarios. It provides three benchmarks for evaluating different tasks: action recognition, temporal action localization, and pose estimation. With 10,000 event segments, totaling 12 billion events and 255 GB of data, Bullying10K contributes significantly by balancing violence detection and personal privacy persevering. And it also poses a challenge to the neuromorphic dataset. It will serve as a valuable resource for training and developing privacy-protecting video systems. The Bullying10K opens new possibilities for innovative approaches in these domains.

Within the complex neuroarchitecture of the brain, astrocytes play crucial roles in development, structure, and metabolism. These cells regulate neural activity through tripartite synapses, directly impacting cognitive processes such as learning and memory. Despite the growing recognition of astrocytes&#x27; significance, traditional Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models remain predominantly neuron-centric, overlooking the profound influence of astrocytes on neural dynamics. Inspired by these biological insights, we have developed an Astrocyte-Modulated Spiking Unit (AM-SU), an innovative framework that integrates neuron-astrocyte interactions into the computational paradigm, demonstrating wide applicability across various hardware platforms. Our Astrocyte-Modulated Spiking Neural Network (AstroSNN) exhibits exceptional performance in tasks involving memory retention and natural language generation, particularly in handling long-term dependencies and complex linguistic structures. The design of AstroSNN not only enhances its biological authenticity but also introduces novel computational dynamics, enabling more effective processing of complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, AstroSNN shows low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory usage in practical applications, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained environments. By successfully integrating astrocytic dynamics into intelligent neural networks, our work narrows the gap between biological plausibility and neural modeling, laying the groundwork for future biologically-inspired neural computing research that includes both neurons and astrocytes.

Although the cause-and-effect relationship between accelerated soil erosion and human activities has been confirmed by geological records, the magnitude and socio-economic drivers of the anthropogenic contribution remain largely unexplained at the country scale. Here, we present an integrated modelling framework that uses multi-source high spatial resolution datasets to assess human-altered soil erosion (HASE) by water and its drivers. We estimate China’s territorial HASE to be equal to 1.35 billion tonnes yr-1 (reference year 2017). This is the result of 2.74 billion tonnes yr-1 of HASE triggered by land-use change activities denoted as HASE luc (~ 1.75 times the estimated natural soil erosion, denoted as SE nat), and 1.39 billion tonnes yr-1 alleviated by soil conservation measures. Modelling activities further indicate that the mitigation due to terraces may have the largest effect on HASE (0.94 billion tonnes yr-1). Concerning socio-economic activities, such as consumption behaviours, we observe that they can indirectly perturb earth surface processes and have a relatively large HASE footprint. Household consumption, especially the final demand from Northeast China and associated industrial activities along the entire supply chain could be the major underlying factors driving HASE. Our findings highlight the intervention of soil erosion by humans and call for comprehensive soil erosion control measures from a social-ecological coupled perspective.

The human brain can self-organize rich and diverse sparse neural pathways to incrementally master hundreds of cognitive tasks. However, most existing continual learning algorithms for deep artificial and spiking neural networks are unable to adequately auto-regulate the limited resources in the network, which leads to performance drop along with energy consumption rise as the increase of tasks. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired continual learning algorithm with adaptive reorganization of neural pathways, which employs Self-Organizing Regulation networks to reorganize the single and limited Spiking Neural Network (SOR-SNN) into rich sparse neural pathways to efficiently cope with incremental tasks. The proposed model demonstrates consistent superiority in performance, energy consumption, and memory capacity on diverse continual learning tasks ranging from child-like simple to complex tasks, as well as on generalized CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets. In particular, the SOR-SNN model excels at learning more complex tasks as well as more tasks, and is able to integrate the past learned knowledge with the information from the current task, showing the backward transfer ability to facilitate the old tasks. Meanwhile, the proposed model exhibits self-repairing ability to irreversible damage and for pruned networks, could automatically allocate new pathway from the retained network to recover memory for forgotten knowledge.

Determining the characteristics of rainfall erosivity at different times and locations is significant for global and regional soil erosion prevention and control. However, accurate quantification of rainfall erosivity remains a challenge due to the limitations of high-precision and long-time series precipitation data. Here, compared with the rainfall erosivity of 291 meteorological stations on the Chinese Loess Plateau, we evaluated the distribution characteristics and accuracy of rainfall erosivity on different temporal and spatial scales calculated by the ERA5 precipitation dataset. A random forest model was constructed to generate a bias dataset to correct the annual rainfall erosivity. Besides, the relationship between erosivity density (ED) and rainfall patterns was quantified to clarify the characteristics of rainfall erosivity. Conducted analysis suggested that the rainfall erosivity calculated from the ERA5 precipitation dataset has …

<p class="paper-abstract">
The evolution of the human brain has led to the development of complex synaptic plasticity, enabling dynamic adaptation to a constantly evolving world. This progress inspires our exploration into a new paradigm for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs): a Plasticity-Driven Learning Framework (PDLF). This paradigm diverges from traditional neural network models that primarily focus on direct training of synaptic weights, leading to static connections that limit adaptability in dynamic environments. Instead, our approach delves into the heart of synaptic behavior, prioritizing the learning of plasticity rules themselves. This shift in focus from weight adjustment to mastering the intricacies of synaptic change offers a more flexible and dynamic pathway for neural networks to evolve and adapt. Our PDLF does not merely adapt existing concepts of functional and Presynaptic-Dependent Plasticity but redefines them, aligning closely with the dynamic and adaptive nature of biological learning. This reorientation enhances key cognitive abilities in artificial intelligence systems, such as working memory and multitasking capabilities, and demonstrates superior adaptability in complex, real-world scenarios. Moreover, our framework sheds light on the intricate relationships between various forms of plasticity and cognitive functions, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of the brain&#x27;s learning mechanisms. Integrating this groundbreaking plasticity-centric approach in SNNs marks a significant advancement in the fusion of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. It paves the way for developing AI systems that not only learn but also adapt in an ever-changing world, much like the human brain.

During dynamic social interaction, inferring and predicting others&#x27; behaviors through theory of mind (ToM) is crucial for obtaining benefits in cooperative and competitive tasks. Current multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods primarily rely on agent observations to select behaviors, but they lack inspiration from ToM, which limits performance. In this article, we propose a multi-agent ToM decision-making (MAToM-DM) model, which consists of a MAToM spiking neural network (MAToM-SNN) module and a decision-making module. We design two brain-inspired ToM modules (Self-MAToM and Other-MAToM) to predict others&#x27; behaviors based on self-experience and observations of others, respectively. Each agent can adjust its behavior according to the predicted actions of others. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been demonstrated through experiments conducted in cooperative and …

Children possess the ability to learn multiple cognitive tasks sequentially, which is a major challenge toward the long-term goal of artificial general intelligence. Existing continual learning frameworks are usually applicable to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and lack the exploration on more brain-inspired, energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Drawing on continual learning mechanisms during child growth and development, we propose Dynamic Structure Development of Spiking Neural Networks (DSD-SNN) for efficient and adaptive continual learning. When learning a sequence of tasks, the DSD-SNN dynamically assigns and grows new neurons to new tasks and prunes redundant neurons, thereby increasing memory capacity and reducing computational overhead. In addition, the overlapping shared structure helps to quickly leverage all acquired knowledge to new tasks, empowering a single network capable of supporting multiple incremental tasks (without the separate sub-network mask for each task). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on multiple class incremental learning and task incremental learning benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our model could significantly improve performance, learning speed and memory capacity, and reduce computational overhead. Besides, our DSD-SNN model achieves comparable performance with the DNNs-based methods, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for existing SNNs-based continual learning methods.

The backpropagation algorithm has promoted the rapid development of deep learning, but it relies on a large amount of labeled data and still has a large gap with how humans learn. The human brain can quickly learn various conceptual knowledge in a self-organized and unsupervised manner, accomplished through coordinating various learning rules and structures in the human brain. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a general learning rule in the brain, but spiking neural networks (SNNs) trained with STDP alone is inefficient and perform poorly. In this paper, taking inspiration from short-term synaptic plasticity, we design an adaptive synaptic filter and introduce the adaptive spiking threshold as the neuron plasticity to enrich the representation ability of SNNs. We also introduce an adaptive lateral inhibitory connection to adjust the spikes balance dynamically to help the network learn richer features. To …

Soil conservation is of global importance, as accelerated soil erosion by human activity is a primary threat to ecosystem viability. However, the significance and role of soil conservation in reshaping landscape carbon (C) accounting has not been comprehensively integrated in the terrestrial C sink. Here, we present the first integrated assessment of the modified terrestrial C sink and aquatic C transport due to soil conservation for the semiarid Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), the world&#x27;s most vulnerable region to soil erosion. We show a surprisingly low terrestrial‐aquatic C transfer that offset the terrestrial net ecosystem productivity by only 7.5%, which we attribute to the effective implementation of soil conservation practices. Despite the highest soil erosion, the semiarid CLP acts as effective C sink at 43.2 ± 22.6 g C m−2 year−1, which is comparable to temperate forest in absorbing atmospheric CO2. Moreover, C burial …

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been widely used due to their strong biological interpretability and high-energy efficiency. With the introduction of the backpropagation algorithm and surrogate gradient, the structure of SNNs has become more complex, and the performance gap with artificial neural networks (ANNs) has gradually decreased. However, most SNN hardware implementations for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) cannot meet arithmetic or memory efficiency requirements, which significantly restricts the development of SNNs. They do not delve into the arithmetic operations between the binary spikes and synaptic weights or assume unlimited on-chip RAM resources using overly expensive devices on small tasks. To improve arithmetic efficiency, we analyze the neural dynamics of spiking neurons, generalize the SNN arithmetic operation to the multiplex-accumulate operation, and propose a …

The biological neural network is a vast and diverse structure with high neural heterogeneity. Conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) primarily focus on modifying the weights of connections through training while modeling neurons as highly homogenized entities and lacking exploration of neural heterogeneity. Only a few studies have addressed neural heterogeneity by optimizing neuronal properties and connection weights to ensure network performance. However, this strategy impact the specific contribution of neuronal heterogeneity. In this paper, we first demonstrate the challenges faced by backpropagation-based methods in optimizing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and achieve more robust optimization of heterogeneous neurons in random networks using an Evolutionary Strategy (ES). Experiments on tasks such as working memory, continuous control, and image recognition show that neuronal heterogeneity can improve performance, particularly in long sequence tasks. Moreover, we find that membrane time constants play a crucial role in neural heterogeneity, and their distribution is similar to that observed in biological experiments. Therefore, we believe that the neglected neuronal heterogeneity plays an essential role, providing new approaches for exploring neural heterogeneity in biology and new ways for designing more biologically plausible neural networks.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received considerable attention not only for their superiority in energy efficiency with discrete signal processing but also for their natural suitability to integrate multi-scale biological plasticity. However, most SNNs directly adopt the structure of the well-established Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and rarely automatically design Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for SNNs. The neural motifs topology, modular regional structure and global cross-brain region connection of the human brain are the product of natural evolution and can serve as a perfect reference for designing brain-inspired SNN architecture. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (MSE-NAS) for SNN, simultaneously considering micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain topologies as the evolutionary search space. MSE-NAS evolves individual neuron operation, self-organized integration of multiple circuit motifs, and global connectivity across motifs through a brain-inspired indirect evaluation function, Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs). This training-free fitness function could greatly reduce computational consumption and NAS&#x27;s time, and its task-independent property enables the searched SNNs to exhibit excellent transferability on multiple datasets. Furthermore, MSE-NAS show robustness against the training method and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with shorter simulation steps on static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR10-DVS and DVS128-Gesture). The thorough analysis also illustrates the significant performance improvement and consistent bio-interpretability deriving from the topological evolution at different scales and the RDMs fitness function.

Even state-of-the-art deep learning models lack fundamental abilities compared with humans.

The distortion generates illusory contour perception using line gratings abutting each other. We applied the method to MNIST, high-resolution MNIST, and &quot;16-class-ImageNet&quot; silhouettes.
