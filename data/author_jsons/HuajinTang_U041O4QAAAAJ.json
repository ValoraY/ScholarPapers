Current approaches suffer from uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions.

However, the non-uniform, discontinuous nature of their spatially sparse yet temporally dense data presents significant challenges for extracting meaningful spatio-temporal features. Representing such novel data paradigms to provide high-quality inputs for neural network models remains a formidable task. Consequently, a key consideration is how to extract spatio-temporal features from event streams effectively.

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing promises brain-like efficiency, yet today's multi-chip systems scale over PCBs and incur orders-of-magnitude penalties in bandwidth, latency, and energy, undermining biological algorithms and system efficiency. We present DarwinWafer, a hyperscale system-on-wafer that replaces off-chip interconnects with wafer-scale, high-density integration of 64 Darwin3 chiplets on a 300 mm silicon interposer. A GALS NoC within each chiplet and an AER-based asynchronous wafer fabric with hierarchical time-step synchronization provide low-latency, coherent operation across the wafer. Each chiplet implements 2.35 M neurons and 0.1 B synapses, yielding 0.15 B neurons and 6.4 B synapses per wafer.At 333 MHz and 0.8 V, DarwinWafer consumes ~100 W and achieves 4.9 pJ/SOP, with 64 TSOPS peak throughput (0.64 TSOPS/W). Realization is enabled by a holistic chiplet-interposer co-design flow (including an in-house interposer-bump planner with early SI/PI and electro-thermal closure) and a warpage-tolerant assembly that fans out I/O via PCBlets and compliant pogo-pin connections, enabling robust, demountable wafer-to-board integration. Measurements confirm 10 mV supply droop and a uniform thermal profile (34-36 °C) under ~100 W. Application studies demonstrate whole-brain simulations: two zebrafish brains per chiplet with high connectivity fidelity (Spearman r = 0.896) and a mouse brain mapped across 32 chiplets (r = 0.645). To our knowledge, DarwinWafer represents a pioneering demonstration of wafer-scale neuromorphic computing, establishing a viable and scalable path toward large-scale, brain-like computation on silicon by replacing PCB-level interconnects with high-density, on-wafer integration.",

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown great promise in this domain but struggle with motion blur, which often arises in real-world scenarios due to camera or object motion. Existing methods address camera motion blur but fall short in dynamic scenes, where the coupling of camera and object motion complicates multi-view consistency and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose EDyGS, a model designed to reconstruct sharp novel views from event streams and monocular videos of dynamic scenes with motion blur. Our approach introduces a motion-mask 3D Gaussian model that assigns each Gaussian an additional attribute to distinguish between static and dynamic regions. By leveraging this motion mask field, we separate and optimize the static and dynamic regions independently. A progressive learning strategy is adopted, where static regions are reconstructed by jointly optimizing camera poses and learnable 3D Gaussians, while dynamic regions are modeled using an implicit deformation field alongside learnable 3D Gaussians. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that EDyGS effectively handles blurry inputs in dynamic scenes.",

Many studies focus on improving neuron models and also integrate recurrent structures, leveraging their synergistic effects to improve the long-term temporal modeling capabilities of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, these studies often place an excessive emphasis on the role of neurons, overlooking the importance of analyzing neurons and recurrent structures as an integrated framework. In this work, we consider neurons and recurrent structures as an integrated system and conduct a systematic analysis of gradient propagation along the temporal dimension, revealing a challenging gradient vanishing problem. To address this issue, we propose the Skip Recurrent Connection (SRC) as a replacement for the vanilla recurrent structure, effectively mitigating the gradient vanishing problem and enhancing long-term temporal modeling performance. Additionally, we propose the Adaptive Skip Recurrent Connection (ASRC), a method that can learn the skip span of skip recurrent connection in each layer of the network. Experiments show that replacing the vanilla recurrent structure in RSNN with SRC significantly improves the model's performance on temporal benchmark datasets.

To further enhance the performance of event-based object detection, this study proposes a novel hybrid spike vision Transformer (HsVT) model.

This combination enables HsVT to capture spatiotemporal features, improving its capability to handle complex event-based object detection tasks. To support research in this area, we developed and publicly released The Fall Detection Dataset as a benchmark for event-based object detection tasks. This dataset, captured using an event-based camera, ensures facial privacy protection and reduces memory usage due to the event representation format.

The synaptic connections within the motor cortex (internal dynamics) are vital to generate motor commands during movement execution. However, recent studies suggest that proprioception also contribute to motor cortex processing. To investigate the contributions of internal dynamics and proprioceptive feedback to movement execution, we built a recurrent neural network model of the motor cortex; the model receives proprioceptive feedback from a virtual arm performing a delayed-reach task. We found that both internal dynamics and proprioceptive feedback contribute to the resemblance to the real motor cortex data. We then dissected their contributions by disrupting them separately. Internal dynamics dominate the generation of neural population activity, while proprioceptive feedback modulates neural responses and controls movement deceleration. Additionally, proprioceptive feedback improves the network’s robustness in noisy initial conditions. We further investigated the relative importance of the components in proprioceptive feedback and found that hand velocity is most important.

In scenarios with rapid motion or low-light conditions, existing RGB-based deblurring methods struggle to model camera pose and radiance changes during exposure, reducing reconstruction accuracy. Event cameras, capturing continuous brightness changes during exposure, can effectively assist in modeling motion blur and improving reconstruction quality. Therefore, we propose Event-driven Bundle Adjusted Deblur Gaussian Splatting (EBAD-Gaussian), which reconstructs sharp 3D Gaussians from event streams and severely blurred images. This method jointly learns the parameters of these Gaussians while recovering camera motion trajectories during exposure time. Specifically, we first construct a blur loss function by synthesizing multiple latent sharp images during the exposure time, minimizing the difference between real and synthesized blurred images. Then we use event stream to supervise the light intensity changes between latent sharp images at any time within the exposure period, supplementing the light intensity dynamic changes lost in RGB images. Furthermore, we optimize the latent sharp images at intermediate exposure times based on the event-based double integral (EDI) prior, applying consistency constraints to enhance the details and texture information of the reconstructed images. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EBAD-Gaussian can achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction under the condition of blurred images and event stream inputs.",

Moreover, supervised learning-based approaches are susceptible to data bias, resulting in reduced effectiveness when confronted with test inputs exhibiting a domain gap relative to the training data. To address these limitations, we present an event-guided HDR video reconstruction method through building 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), to ensure consistent brightness imposed by 3D consistency. We introduce HDR 3D Gaussians capable of simultaneously representing HDR and low-dynamic-range (LDR) colors.

Based on this relationship, we categorize events into inter-frame events and intra-exposure. The former is utilized for building HDR radiance field and the latter is used to deblur potentially blurred images.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are biologically plausible models known for their computational efficiency. A significant advantage of SNNs lies in the binary information transmission through spike trains, eliminating the need for multiplication operations. However, due to the spatio-temporal nature of SNNs, direct application of traditional backpropagation (BP) training still results in significant computational costs. Meanwhile, learning methods based on unsupervised synaptic plasticity provide an alternative for training SNNs but often yield suboptimal results. Thus, efficiently training high-accuracy SNNs remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a highly efficient and biologically plausible spiking time sparse feedback (STSF) learning method. This algorithm modifies synaptic weights by incorporating a neuromodulator for global supervised learning using sparse direct feedback alignment (DFA) and local …",

Frame-based methods for novel space-time view synthesis in dynamic scenes rely on simplistic motion assumptions due to the absence of inter-frame cues, which makes them fall in complex motion. Event camera captures inter-frame cues with high temporal resolution, which makes it hold the promising potential to handle high speed and complex motion. However, it is still difficult due to the event noise and sparsity. To mitigate the impact caused by event noise and sparsity, we propose E-NeMF, which alleviates the impact of event noise with Parametric Motion Representation and mitigates the event sparsity with Flow Prediction Module. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate our superior performance in handling high-speed and complex motion.",

However, most work relies solely on experimental analysis and lacks theoretical support, and the direct-encoding method and fixed membrane potential leak factor they used in spiking neurons are simplified simulations of those in the biological nervous system, which makes it difficult to ensure generalizability across all datasets and networks. Contrarily, the biological nervous system can stay reliable even in a highly complex noise environment, one of the reasons is selective visual attention and non-fixed membrane potential leaks in biological neurons. This biological finding has inspired us to design a highly robust SNN model that closely mimics the biological nervous system. In our study, we first present a unified theoretical framework for SNN robustness constraint, which suggests that improving the encoding method and evolution of the membrane potential leak factor in spiking neurons can improve SNN robustness. Subsequently, we propose a robust SNN (FEEL-SNN) with Frequency Encoding (FE) and Evolutionary Leak factor (EL) to defend against different noises, mimicking the selective visual attention mechanism and non-fixed leak observed in biological systems. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of both our FE, EL, and FEEL methods, either in isolation or in conjunction with established robust enhancement algorithms, for enhancing the robustness of SNNs.",

In the past few years, various new schemes in this field have sprung up to explore more general AI.

What are the key issues to enhance the development of BIC? What roles do the current mainstream technologies play in the general framework of BIC?

Despite recent advances in improving surface reconstruction accuracy, the reconstructed results still exhibit bias and suffer from inefficiency in storage and training. This paper provides a different observation on the cause of the inefficiency and the reconstruction bias, which is attributed to the integration of the low-opacity parts (LOPs) of the generated Gaussians. We show that LOPs consist of Gaussians with overall low-opacity (LOGs) and the low-opacity tails (LOTs) of Gaussians. We propose Spiking GS to reduce such two types of LOPs by integrating spiking neurons into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. Specifically, we introduce global and local full-precision integrate-and-fire spiking neurons to the opacity and representation function of flattened 3D Gaussians, respectively. Furthermore, we enhance the density control strategy with spiking neurons' thresholds and a new criterion on the scale of Gaussians.

    "abstract": "Event streams output by event cameras have low data redundancy and retain accurate temporal information in the form of Address Event Representation (AER) which are different from the outputs of traditional frame-based cameras. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered an effective tool for handling event-based scenarios due to their inherent temporal properties. However, most existing SNNs directly convert an event stream to several static frames with temporal relationships by channel-wise accumulation of events. These serial frames lose temporal characteristics in some extent and potentially affect the capacity of the SNNs to learn and recognize event streams. In this work, we proposed a novel event-based feature descriptor called time interval correlation time-surface (TICTS) for SNNs and introduced this event-based feature extraction method into SNNs. The TICTS can capture more precise …",

However, the output of event cameras is a sparse and discrete event stream, with each individual event in the event streams containing only little information. Therefore, extracting more effective features from the available information in the event streams is currently a major challenge in event-based object classification. In this paper, we propose a novel event-based feature representation to encode the spatiotemporal features of event streams. The Harmonic Mean Time Surfaces (HMTS) representation makes efficient use of information about past events, which enhances the spatiotemporal relationship between events, thus establishing robust representation.

    "abstract": "Spiking federated learning is an emerging distributed learning paradigm that allows resource-constrained devices to train collaboratively at low power consumption without exchanging local data. It takes advantage of both the privacy computation property in federated learning (FL) and the energy efficiency in spiking neural networks (SNN). Thus, it is highly promising to revolutionize the efficient processing of multimedia data. However, existing spiking federated learning methods employ a random selection approach for client aggregation, assuming unbiased client participation. This neglect of statistical heterogeneity affects the convergence and accuracy of the global model significantly. In our work, we propose a credit assignment-based active client selection strategy, the SFedCA, to judiciously aggregate clients that contribute to the global sample distribution balance. Specifically, the client credits are assigned by the firing intensity state before and after local model training, which reflects the local data distribution difference from the global model. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID) scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the SFedCA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art spiking federated learning methods, and requires fewer communication rounds.",

A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs), compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs), have more characteristics that align with biological neurons, which may be helpful as a potential gating function for knowledge maintenance in neural networks. Inspired by the selective sparse activation principle of context gating in biological systems, we present a novel SNN model with selective activation to achieve continual learning. The trace-based K-Winner-Take-All (K-WTA) and variable threshold components are designed to form the sparsity in selective activation in spatial and temporal dimensions of spiking neurons, which promotes the subpopulation of neuron activation to perform specific tasks. As a result, continual learning can be maintained by routing different tasks via different populations of neurons in the network. The experiments are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets under the class incremental setting. The results show that the proposed SNN model achieves competitive performance similar to and even surpasses the other regularization-based methods deployed under traditional ANNs.",

Neuroscience research has shown that the mammalian brain entorhinal-hippocampal system provides efficient graph representations for general knowledge. Moreover, entorhinal grid cells present concise spatial representations, while hippocampal place cells represent perception conjunctions effectively. Thus, the entorhinal-hippocampal system provides a novel angle for spatiotemporal representation, which inspires us to propose the SpatioTemporal aware Embedding framework (STE) and apply it to POIs (STEP). STEP considers two types of POI-specific representations: sequential representation and spatiotemporal conjunctive representation, learned using sparse unlabeled data based on the proposed graph-building policies. Notably, STEP jointly represents the spatiotemporal natures of POIs using both observations and contextual information from integrated spatiotemporal dimensions by constructing a spatiotemporal context graph.

However, the simplified biological properties of LIF ignore the neuronal coupling and dendritic structure of real neurons, which limits the spatio-temporal dynamics of neurons and thus reduce the expressive power of the resulting SNNs. In this work, we leverage a more biologically plausible neural model with complex dynamics, i.e., a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN), to improve the expressiveness and recognition performance of SNNs for vision tasks. The PCNN is a type of cortical model capable of emulating the complex neuronal activities in the primary visual cortex. We construct deep pulse-coupled neural networks (DPCNNs) by replacing commonly used LIF neurons in SNNs with PCNN neurons. The intra-coupling in existing PCNN models limits the coupling between neurons only within channels. To address this limitation, we propose inter-channel coupling, which allows neurons in different feature maps to interact with each other. Experimental results show that inter-channel coupling can efficiently boost performance with fewer neurons, synapses, and less training time compared to widening the networks. For instance, compared to the LIF-based SNN with wide VGG9, DPCNN with VGG9 uses only 50%, 53%, and 73% of neurons, synapses, and training time, respectively. Furthermore, we propose receptive field and time dependent batch normalization (RFTD-BN) to speed up the convergence and performance of DPCNNs.",

This work presents the temporal conditioning spiking latent variable models (TeCoS-LVM) to simulate the neural response to natural visual stimuli. We use spiking neurons to produce spike outputs that directly match the recorded trains. This approach helps to avoid losing information embedded in the original spike trains.

We show that TeCoS-LVM models can produce more realistic spike activities and accurately fit spike statistics than powerful alternatives. Additionally, learned TeCoS-LVM models can generalize well to longer time scales.

Variational autoencoders (VAEs), as one of the most popular image generation models, have attracted a lot of work exploring their SNN implementation. Due to the constrained binary representation in SNNs, existing SNN VAE methods implicitly construct the latent space by an elaborated autoregressive network and use the network outputs as the sampling variables. However, this unspecified implicit representation of the latent space will increase the difficulty of generating high-quality images and introduces additional network parameters.

    "abstract": "To navigate in space, it is important to predict headings in real-time from neural responses in the brain to vestibular and visual signals, and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) is one of the critical brain areas. However, it remains unexplored in the population level how the heading perception is represented in VIP. And there are no commonly used methods suitable for decoding the headings from the population responses in VIP, given the large spatiotemporal dynamics and heterogeneity in the neural responses. Here, responses were recorded from 210 VIP neurons in three rhesus monkeys when they were performing a heading perception task. And by specifically and separately modelling the both dynamics with sparse representation, we built a sequential sparse autoencoder (SSAE) to do the population decoding on the recorded dataset and tried to maximize the decoding performance. The SSAE relies on a three …",

    "abstract": "Traditional spiking learning algorithm aims to train neurons to spike at a specific time or on a particular frequency, which requires precise time and frequency labels in the training process. While in reality, usually only aggregated labels of sequential patterns are provided. The aggregate-label (AL) learning is proposed to discover these predictive features in distracting background streams only by aggregated spikes. It has achieved much success recently, but it is still computationally intensive and has limited use in deep networks. To address these issues, we propose an event-driven spiking aggregate learning algorithm (SALA) in this article. Specifically, to reduce the computational complexity, we improve the conventional spike-threshold-surface (STS) calculation in AL learning by analytical calculating voltage peak values in spiking neurons. Then we derive the algorithm to multilayers by event-driven strategy …",

    "abstract": "The human brain exhibits remarkable abilities in integrating temporally distant sensory inputs for decision-making. However, existing brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have struggled to match their biological counterpart in modeling long-term temporal relationships. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel Contextual Embedding Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CE-LIF) spiking neuron model. Specifically, the CE-LIF model incorporates a meticulously designed contextual embedding component into the adaptive neuronal firing threshold, thereby enhancing the memory storage of spiking neurons and facilitating effective sequential modeling. Additionally, theoretical analysis is provided to elucidate how the CE-LIF model enables long-term temporal credit assignment. Remarkably, when compared to state-of-the-art recurrent SNNs, feedforward SNNs comprising the proposed CE-LIF neurons demonstrate superior performance across extensive sequential modeling tasks in terms of classification accuracy, network convergence speed, and memory capacity.",

First, the dynamic motion features in the event stream are extracted using the event-based motion history information representation and gradient direction calculation. Then, the spatiotemporal pooling operation is introduced to eliminate the redundancy of events in the temporal and spatial domain, further retaining the significant motion features. Finally, the feature event streams are fed into the SNN for learning and recognition. Experiments conducted on benchmark dynamic visual datasets show that dynamic visual motion features can significantly improve the recognition accuracy and computational speed of SNN for event streams.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have increasingly drawn massive research attention due to biological interpretability and efficient computation. Recent achievements are devoted to utilizing the surrogate gradient (SG) method to avoid the dilemma of non-differentiability of spiking activity to directly train SNNs by backpropagation. However, the fixed width of the SG leads to gradient vanishing and mismatch problems, thus limiting the performance of directly trained SNNs. In this work, we propose a novel perspective to unlock the width limitation of SG, called the learnable surrogate gradient (LSG) method. The LSG method modulates the width of SG according to the change of the distribution of the membrane potentials, which is identified to be related to the decay factors based on our theoretical analysis. Then we introduce the trainable decay factors to implement the LSG method, which can optimize the width of SG automatically during training to avoid the gradient vanishing and mismatch problems caused by the limited width of SG. We evaluate the proposed LSG method on both image and neuromorphic datasets. Experimental results show that the LSG method can effectively alleviate the blocking of gradient propagation caused by the limited width of SG when training deep SNNs directly. Meanwhile, the LSG method can help SNNs achieve competitive performance on both latency and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biologically inspired spatio-temporal dynamics demonstrate superior energy efficiency on neuromorphic architectures. Error backpropagation in SNNs is prohibited by the all-or-none nature of spikes. The existing solution circumvents this problem by a relaxation on the gradient calculation using a continuous function with a constant relaxation de-gree, so-called surrogate gradient learning. Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise. In this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs. The theoretical analysis further shows optimization on such a noisy network could be evolved into optimization on the embedded SNN with shared weights progressively. Moreover, The experiments on static images, dynamic event streams, speech, and instrumental sounds show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets with remarkable robustness on different relaxation degrees.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have manifested remarkable advantages in power consumption and event-driven property during the inference process. To take full advantage of low power consumption and improve the efficiency of these models further, the pruning methods have been explored to find sparse SNNs without redundancy connections after training. However, parameter redundancy still hinders the efficiency of SNNs during training. In the human brain, the rewiring process of neural networks is highly dynamic, while synaptic connections maintain relatively sparse during brain development. Inspired by this, here we propose an efficient evolutionary structure learning (ESL) framework for SNNs, named ESL-SNNs, to implement the sparse SNN training from scratch. The pruning and regeneration of synaptic connections in SNNs evolve dynamically during learning, yet keep the structural sparsity at a certain level. As a result, the ESL-SNNs can search for optimal sparse connectivity by exploring all possible parameters across time. Our experiments show that the proposed ESL-SNNs framework is able to learn SNNs with sparse structures effectively while reducing the limited accuracy. The ESL-SNNs achieve merely 0.28% accuracy loss with 10% connection density on the DVS-Cifar10 dataset. Our work presents a brand-new approach for sparse training of SNNs from scratch with biologically plausible evolutionary mechanisms, closing the gap in the expressibility between sparse training and dense training. Hence, it has great potential for SNN lightweight training and inference with low power consumption and small memory usage.",

In this study, we scrutinized the importance of nonlinear dendrites within neural networks. By employing machine-learning methodologies, we assessed the impact of dendritic structure nonlinearity on neural network performance. Our findings reveal that integrating dendritic structures can substantially enhance model capacity and performance while keeping signal communication costs effectively restrained.

In this paper, a heuristic symmetric-threshold rectified linear unit (stReLU) activation function for ANNs is proposed, based on the intrinsically different responses between the integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons in SNNs and the activation functions in ANNs. The negative threshold in stReLU can guarantee the conversion of negative activations, and the symmetric thresholds enable positive error to offset negative error between activation value and spike firing rate, thus reducing the conversion error from ANNs to SNNs.

However, the performance of some current spiking-based models is limited by their structures which means either fully connected or too-deep structures bring too much redundancy. This redundancy from both connection and neurons is one of the key factors hindering the practical application of SNNs. Although Some pruning methods were proposed to tackle this problem, they normally ignored the fact the neural topology in the human brain could be adjusted dynamically. Inspired by this, this paper proposed an evolutionary-based structure construction method for constructing more reasonable SNNs. By integrating the knowledge distillation and connection pruning method, the synaptic connections in SNNs can be optimized dynamically to reach an optimal state. As a result, the structure of SNNs could not only absorb knowledge from the teacher model but also search for deep but sparse network topology. Experimental results on CIFAR100 and DVS-Gesture show that the proposed structure learning method can get pretty well performance while reducing the connection redundancy.

Although spiking based models are energy efficient by taking advantage of discrete spike signals, their performance is limited by current network structures and their training methods. As discrete signals, typical SNNs cannot apply the gradient descent rules directly into parameters adjustment as artificial neural networks (ANNs). Aiming at this limitation, here we propose a novel method of constructing deep SNN models with knowledge distillation (KD) that uses ANN as teacher model and SNN as student model. Through ANN-SNN joint training algorithm, the student SNN model can learn rich feature information from the teacher ANN model through the KD method, yet it avoids training SNN from scratch when communicating with non-differentiable spikes. Our method can not only build a more efficient deep spiking structure feasibly and reasonably, but use few time steps to train whole model compared to direct training or ANN to SNN methods. More importantly, it has a superb ability of noise immunity for various types of artificial noises and natural signals.
